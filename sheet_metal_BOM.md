# BOM

## DISCLAIMER: This is an EXPERIMENTAL release. The files and the BOM will change with more feedback. Please don't build it (yet) if you're not okay with potentially burning money and time!

## Rails

- **Y rails:** stock length MGN9H (no preload is recommended)
- **X rail:**  stock length MGN9H/MGN12H (Z2 preload MGN12H is recommended)

## X axis

Any stock-compatible X beam will work with the suitable mounting hardware

## Homing

Sensorless only for now.

## Extrusions

- all of the gantry extrusions are stock
- there's an optional 2020 front brace for AWD that has the same length as the X rail

## Short shafted double shear support
- currently only possible with printed top bearing housings
- will require 4 identical motor plates instead of 2-2 of each
