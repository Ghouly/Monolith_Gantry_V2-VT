## What's this?
It's the experimental sheet metal version of the Monolith gantry that brings R1 features such as live shafts, increased tensioner range, and the optional zero protrusion mode.

### Pros:
- no load-bearing printed parts in the XY motion system
- low cost, easy to source
- high performance
- public CAD

### Cons:
- significantly higher complexity compared to the printed version
- lots of post-processing
- harder to align
- ugly
